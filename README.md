# automail

A service provider written in Rust using Rocket that generates autoconfig and autodiscover XML files for Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange and Thunderbird to automatically configure e-mail.

# Configuration

An example configuration file (`config.toml.example`) can be found in this repository.
More information about how to configure automail can be found in [Rocket's documentation](https://rocket.rs/v0.5-rc/guide/configuration/#profiles).
In addition, there is also a guide that discusses installing, configuring and running [automail on Alpine Linux](https://codentium.com/guides/alpine/automail/).
